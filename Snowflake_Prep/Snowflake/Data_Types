DATA TYPES IN SNOWFLAKE : 

OBJECT - Unordered set of name value pairs . 
          
        {
           "topic":"Snowflake",
           "level":"All levels"
        }



ARRAY -  Consists of 0 or more pieces of data 

         [ "USA" , "India" , "Canada" ]        


VARIANT -  Can store values of any other data type including ARRAY and OBJECT 
           Suitable to store and query semi-structured data .

           SQL nulls are just stored as "null" strings . They are called JSON null (or "VARIANT null") 

           Non-native strings (e.g. dates ) are stored in strings 

           Maximum length is 16 MB 


           USE CASES : 
                       Explicitely define hierarchy of ARRAYs and OBJECTs

           Let Snowflake convert semi-structured data into hierarchy of ARRAY , OBJECT and VARIANT data stored into VARIANT . 


           CREATE FILE FORMAT my_fileformat
           TYPE = { JSON | AVRO | XML | PARQUET | ORC }           



Loading semi-structure data 

VARIANT - Native support for semi-structured data 

Step 1: Load the data as it is and transform it later .   ELT Approach 

Step 2: Extract & Load raw data (VARIANT)

Step 3: Analyse/Parse 

Step 4: Flatten
