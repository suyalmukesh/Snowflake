What is a directory table ? 

Stores metadata of staged files : 

    Layered on a stage 
    Can be queried with sufficient privileges (on stage)
    Retrieve file URLs to access files 
    Needs to be enabled for stages 


CREATE STAGE stage_azure 
URL = <'url'>
STORAGE_INTEGRATION = STORAGE_INTEGRATION_object
DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE)
-- DEFAULT = FALSE
